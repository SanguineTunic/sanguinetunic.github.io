#### Sanguine's Startup Utilities <a href="https://github.com/SanguineTunic/StartupUtilites" target="_blank">(Repository)</a>

A simple Windows program made to execute various things after the startup of your System.
It can be used to open your daily working environment or to set a gretting message in form of a .wav file.
You can also use it to run any CMD command or to automatically shutdown your system after a fixed time.

Any wishes and improvements can be posted in my <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/sanguinetunic/suggestions-and-wishes-t2.html">Suggestions and Wishes</a> thread.
A Linux and/or Mac version might be coming, if enough people request it.

Here you can see the current two pages of the GUI with all the settings:

Please Note: I don't take any responsibility for any damages that may be caused by (inappropriate) use of this program.

Help for Advanced Settings: /K on the beginning of the command to see the cmd window. /C to make the window invisible
